        console              open an ssh session to the host
        list                 list previous deploy commits
        [ref]                deploy to [ref], the 'ref' setting, or latest tag

## Configuration

 By default `deploy(1)` will look for _./deploy.conf_, consisting of one or more environments, `[stage]`, `[production]`, etc, followed by directives.

    [stage]
    key /path/to/some.pem
    user deployer
    host n.n.n.n
    repo git@github.com:visionmedia/express.git
    path /var/www/myapp.com
    ref origin/master
    post-deploy /var/www/myapp.com/update.sh

## Directives

### key (optional)

  Path to identity file used by `ssh -i`.

      key /path/to/some.pem

### ref (optional)

  When specified, __HEAD__ is reset to `ref`. When deploying
  production typically this will _not_ be used, as `deploy(1)` will
  utilize the most recent tag by default, however this is useful
  for a staging environment, as shown below where __HEAD__ is updated
  and set to the develop branch.

        ref origin/develop

### user

  User for deployment.

       user deployer

### host

  Server hostname.

       host 50.17.255.50

### repo

  GIT repository to clone.

       repo git@github.com:visionmedia/express.git

### path

  Deployment path.

        path /var/www/myapp.com

### forward-agent

  Webhosts normally use read-only deploy keys to access private git repositories.
  If you'd rather use the credentials of the person invoking the deploy
  command, put `forward-agent yes` in the relevant config sections.
  Now the deploy script will invoke `ssh -A` when deploying and there's
  no need to keep SSH keys on your servers.

### needs_tty

  If your deployment scripts require any user interaction (which they shouldn't, but
  often do) you'll probably want SSH to allocate a tty for you. Put `needs_tty yes`
  in the config section if you'd like the deploy script to invoke `ssh -t` and ensure
  you have a tty available.

## Hooks

  All hooks are arbitrary commands, executed relative to `path/current`,
  aka the previous deployment for `pre-deploy`, and the new deployment
  for `post-deploy`. Of course you may specify absolute paths as well.

### pre-deploy

      pre-deploy ./bin/something

### post-deploy

      post-deploy ./bin/restart

### test

  Post-deployment test command after `post-deploy`. If this
  command fails, `deploy(1)` will attempt to revert to the previous
  deployment, ignoring tests (for now), as they are assumed to have run correctly.

      test ./something
